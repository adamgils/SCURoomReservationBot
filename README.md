# SCU Room Reservation Bot
Requires Selenium & Chrome Driver

## Description
This bot, which I made with Python, allows me to book room reservations in the SCU Library which open up 7 days in advance using Selenium and Chrome Driver. Every day it reserves the room LC 210 7 days ahead during times which I am free in my schedule so I never have to worry about having to reserve this room. I chose the room LC 210 because it is one of few rooms in the library with a floor to ceiling window and natural light.

## Contribution
I hope this will be of value to anyone hoping to create a similar bot, whether that also be for reserving rooms, restaurants, or anything else.

Please reach out to me at agilani@scu.edu with any feedback or questions you might have.
